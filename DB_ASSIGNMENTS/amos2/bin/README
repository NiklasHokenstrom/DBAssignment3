Running the AMOS II system from a console window
------------------------------------------------ 

1. Unpack the downloaded zip file to some location of your choice in your
   file system.

2. Run the program
      amos2
   This program puts you in the Amos II top loop (console) where
   AmosQL commands are entered and executed.

3. (Optional) If you wish to run the system from the command line
   anywhere in your file system you should set the environment
   variable PATH to include first '.' and then the location of this 
   'bin' directory. 

AMOS II documentation and tutorials:
------------------------------------

To learn a little how to use Amos II:

1. There is an introductory tutorial in
       http://www.it.uu.se/research/group/udbl/amos/doc/intro.amosql
   Open the file in a text editor, cut-and-paste the commands into
   the Amos II console for evaluation, and study the responses. 

2. The Amos II manual is in:
       http://www.it.uu.se/research/group/udbl/amos/doc/amos_users_guide.html

3. There is an introduction to object-oriented database design with
   Amos II in:
       http://www.it.uu.se/research/group/udbl/amos/doc/tut.pdf

4. There is a tutorial on object-oriented database design with Amos II in:
       http://www.it.uu.se/research/group/udbl/amos/doc/tutorial.amosql
   Open the file in a text editor and cut-and-paste. 
   There is extra data for the tutorial in
       http://www.it.uu.se/research/group/udbl/amos/doc/wcdata.amosql

 
Interface to Java language and GOOVI browser:
---------------------------------------------

Run Amos within the Java virtual machine by calling the command
procedure (Windows) or executable (Unix):

           javaamos <database image file> 

   'javaamos' requires as first parameter the name of a database image file.
   The default image is 'amos2.dmp' in the 'bin' folder.
 
   With 'javaamos' You will enter the Amos II top loop (console) as with
   'amos2', but 'javamos' runs inside the Java virtual machine. 

   The multi-database browser Goovi can be started under 'javaamos' with the 
   following function call:

           goovi(); 


Special for Linux:
------------------

Under Linux the variable LD_LIBRARY_PATH must be set to this 'bin'
directory.


Special for OSX:
----------------

Copy the Amos II root folder to your preferred location in your home
folder. Notice that if you click on 'amos2' from the finder, an Amos
II console will be opened with the current working directory being
your home folder.
